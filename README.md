# University Timetable Management System

## Introduction

The University Timetable Management System is a RESTful API developed to streamline the process of creating, modifying, and querying class schedules within a university context. Designed to cater to the needs of students, faculty, and administrative staff, the system provides a user-friendly and secure interface to manage academic timetables efficiently.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- *Backend*: Express JS (Node.js) - A robust framework for building RESTful APIs.
- *Frontend*: React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly suited for single-page applications.
- *Database*: MongoDB - A NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

The system's data model consists of several key entities:

- *Course*: Represents academic courses that can contain multiple modules.
- *Module*: Individual parts of a course, with a specific focus and taught during a particular semester.
- *Timetable*: Links courses/modules with specific times and locations for classes.
- *User*: Generalized entity for all system users, with specializations for Admin, Faculty, and Student roles.
- *ClassRoom*: Designated spaces where classes are held, identified by features such as location, capacity, and type (e.g., lecture hall, lab).
- *Resource*: Assets such as projectors or computers that are allocated to facilitate teaching and learning activities.
- *Booking*: Records the reservation of classrooms and resources, ensuring no scheduling conflicts for academic sessions or events.
- *Notification*: Alerts and messages sent to system users to inform them of schedule changes, announcements, or other important information.



# Functional Requirements:
1. *User Roles and Authentication:*
- Define multiple user roles (e.g., Admin, Faculty, Student) with different access 
levels.
- Implement secure login functionality and session management using JWT.
2. *Course Management:*
- Allow CRUD operations on courses, including course name, code, description, and 
credits.
- Enable Admins to assign Faculty to courses.
3. *Timetable Management:*
- Facilitate the creation and modification of weekly timetables for different courses.
- Include functionality to add, update, and delete class sessions, specifying the 
course, time, faculty, and location.
4. *Room and Resource Booking:*
- Manage classrooms and resources (e.g., projectors, labs) availability.
- Allow booking of rooms and resources for classes or events, ensuring no overlaps.
5. *Student Enrollment:*
- Enable students to enroll in courses and view their timetables.
- Allow Faculty and Admins to view and manage student enrollments in courses.
6. *Notifications and Alerts:*
- Implement a system to notify users of timetable changes, room changes, or 
important announcements.


## Features and Functions

- *User Authentication*: Secure login functionality with session management.
- *Course Management*: Full CRUD operations on courses and association with faculty.
- *Timetable Management*: Creation and updates to weekly timetables with class session details.
- *ClassRoom and Resource Booking*: Scheduling resources to prevent booking conflicts.
- *Notifications*: Alerts on schedule changes and announcements.
